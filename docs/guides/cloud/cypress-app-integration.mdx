Developers will spend most of their time authoring tests in the [Cypress App](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app).
Cypress Cloud and the Cypress App are closely integrated, allowing you to start debugging your tests as soon
as they fail.

## Runs Page

The Runs page in the Cypress App shows real time information about the current state of your tests running via Cypress
Cloud. This allows you to quickly see the status of your current branches, and also what other developers are working 
on.

Rather than waiting and watching CI, the Cypress App can send you desktop [Notifications](#Notifications) letting you
know when runs start, stop, pass, or fail.

## Notifications

The Cypress App can send you desktop notifications letting you know when a:

- run starts
- run begins to fail 
- run completes with:
  - Passed
  - Failed (enabled by default)
  - Canceled
  - Errored (only includes errored, and not timed out or no tests)

## Enabling Notifications

Notifications are not enabled by default. You can enable them by opening the Cypress App, clicking "Settings", 
expanding "Device settings" and clicking "Enable desktop notifications".

<DocsImage

  alt="Enable notifications"
/>

You can send a test notification to ensure everything is working as expected:

  alt="Sending a test notification"
/>

If this is not working as expected, see [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) below.

## Troubleshooting

Notifications and the associated permissions work slightly differently on each operating system.

### macOS

If notifications are not showing up in macOS, under "System Preferences" select "Notifications" and choose "Cypress":

  alt="Notification in System Preferences for macOS"
/>

Then turn on notifications for Cypress:

  alt="Enable Cypress Notifications"
/>

### Linux

How your desktop manages notifications depends on your Linux distribution your windows manager. 
If you are not seeing notifications when you think you should be, 
please file an issue including the operating system and version.

### Windows

Notifications for Windows is currently not supported. Support will be added in a later release.
